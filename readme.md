## Hi, I'm Tweet Monkey

Tweet Monkey is a hilariously simple maker project.

Many of the maker projects you'll find online are intended to flex the muscles of a given maker or technology and end up being rather complicated and difficult to replicate.

Tweet Monkey is an attempt to create a project that crosses a number of maker disciplines while remaining conceptually simple. It's easy to acquire the needed materials, and hopefully when you've built a Tweet Monkey, you'll have a good grasp on a number of concepts.

Tweet Monkey monitors Twitter for tweets that contain the hashtag #tweetmonkey. When someone (anyone in the world) tweets with #tweetmonkey, your Tweet Monkey will animate (clang his symbols, nod his head, and squawk) for a couple of seconds.

This project takes advantage of Node.js which makes accessing Twitter a breeze. It's designed such that the work of looking for tweets is offloaded to Twitter - afterall, they know quite well how to search for tweets and they have a few servers to do the work. Tweet Monkey just hangs out waiting for Twitter to push down notification.

The entirety of the code for Tweet Monkey easily fits on a single page. It's very short. I like short code that expresses the essence of what I'm trying to do.

I encourage you to make a Tweet Monkey yourself. The effort is small and you'll get a fun introduction to maker projects that use software and electronics together.

## Getting Started
First, you'll need to buy some stuff. There's not getting around it. Unless, that is, you've attended one of my events and gotten a complete Tweet Monkey kit!

Here are the steps for building your own...

1. [Buy the stuff](docs/buy.md)
1. [Modify the monkey](docs/modify.md)
1. [Complete the circuit](docs/circuit.md)
1. [Prep your Raspberry Pi](docs/preppi.md)
1. [Sign up to use the Twitter API](docs/twitter.md)
1. [Write the code](docs/code.md)
1. [Deploy and run the program](docs/deploy.md)

So there you have it - a simple, end-to-end Tweet Monkey! Just what everyone needs.

I hope you had fun with the monkey specifically, but more importantly, I hope you're just a little bit more comfortable hooking into an existing electronic circuit and using logic from a program you wrote to manipulate it. When you get the concepts behind the procedures, you really start to see the possibilities, and _that_ is the heart of the maker movement.
