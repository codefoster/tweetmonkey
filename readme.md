##Welcome to Tweet Monkey
Tweet Monkey is a hilariously simple maker project. You can make one yourself with little effort and get a quick and fun introduction to maker projects that use software and electronics together.
This project has been broken into multiple repositories to support different hardware you might choose. The easiest way to get started is to go to [tweetmonkey.io](http://tweetmonkey.io). That online tutorial is going to take you to one of the following repositories...

*[tweetmonkey-edison](http://github.com/codefoster/tweetmonkey-edison) for the Intel Edison using Node.js
* [tweetmonkey-raspi](http://github.com/codefoster/tweetmoneky-raspi) for the Raspberry Pi running Node.js on Raspian
*...and more to come!
