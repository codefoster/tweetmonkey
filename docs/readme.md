## Getting Started
Here are the steps for building your very own Tweet Monkey...

1. [Buy the stuff](buy.md)
1. [Modify the monkey](modify.md)
1. [Complete the circuit](circuit.md)
1. [Prep your Raspberry Pi](preppi.md)
1. [Sign up to use the Twitter API](twitter.md)
1. [Write the code](code.md)
1. [Deploy and run the program](deploy.md)

So there you have it - a simple, end-to-end Tweet Monkey! Just what everyone needs.

I hope you have fun with the monkey specifically, but more importantly, I hope you're just a little bit more comfortable hooking into an existing electronic circuit and using logic from a program you wrote to manipulate it. When you get the concepts behind the procedures, you really start to see the possibilities, and _that_ is the heart of the maker movement.
