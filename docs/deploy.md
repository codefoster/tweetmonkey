## Deploy and run the program

So next we are going SSH to the device and run it.
To SSH, use...
```
ssh root@(device-name)

Once on the device, cd to the project directory (it should be in the default location depicted by the ~ in the prompt - this is likely /home/root) and then use...

```
node app.js
```
